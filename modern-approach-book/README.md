# Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach

This directory includes notes I'm taking while reading the book [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/dp/0134610997).

I'm trying to implement the algorithms that are interesting to me and practice python at the same time.
